In cmd prompt type "jupyter notebook" and the jupyter notebook will open up so you can view the ipynb file.

If you do not have jupyter notebook please go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and you can download it and you will get jupyter notebook as part of the download.

help(np.random.permutation)

help(np.random.normal)
help(np.random.lognormal)
help(np.random.binomial)
